## LoopNet: Musical Loop Synthsis Conditioned on Intuitive Musical Parameters

### Pritish Chandna, António Ramires, Xavier Serra, Emilia Gómez

On this website, we present audio examples of our drum loop synthesis models. The code to replicate these results is available at our [Github Repository](https://github.com/aframires/drum-loop-synthesis), and an interactive Jupyter Notebook is available at [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/aframires/drum-loop-synthesis/blob/main/LOOPNET.ipynb)

### Reconstruction of sounds from the test set
In this section, we show how the different models behave when recreating loops from the test set. These loops were not included in the training of the models. 

### Examples of Timbre Transfer
In this section, we show examples of combining the timbre of loops from our test set with the rhythm of others. 

### Examples of Drum Separation
Here we show examples of separating the different elements of drum loops (kick, snare and hi-hat).
